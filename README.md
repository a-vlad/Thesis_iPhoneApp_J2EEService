# Thesis_iPhoneApp_J2EEService
UNSW iPhone App + J2EE Service Thesis 


UNSW Thesis Project for my Bachelor of Software Engineering degree
App + Service for searching field of all cars on the Australian market provided through Fairfax sponsored project. 
User would be able to search car field, find cars that matched certain specifications and retrieve extra details for each car.

Search field allowed for recursive searches to be triggered from within the results field using "Similar Cars" feature or "Tradeoff" feature.

Service
========
J2EE web service would interface with SQL database and execute stored routines.

Results would be serialized and returned to iPhone app.


iPhone App
=========
iPhone app would render results and display them.

Project written with XCode 3 with no ARC. Manual reference counting was used to manage object lifecycle.

UI + Service + iPhone app all written by myself through the course of one semester.
